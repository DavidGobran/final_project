We have 2 ideas, we want to get your feedback on which will be more doable in the timeframe:

1. high school diving state meet tracker thing: for high school springboard drivers there are certain requirements that need to be made simultaneously to qualify for sectional and state meets, you need to get a certain overall score, get a certain score for certain dives, and qualify a certain number&type of those dives.
    - can create something for both divers and coaches to know who has qualified to what meets and under what conditions
